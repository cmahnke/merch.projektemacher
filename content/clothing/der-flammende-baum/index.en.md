The motif on the book originally had no reference to Christmas, but here it is on the project maker Christmas hoodie 2025.

[Frida Schanz](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frida_Schanz) (1859-1944), was a very active author of children's and young adult books at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century. The illustration is by [Hugo Steiner-Prag](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Steiner-Prag), who also illustrated The Golem, for example.
